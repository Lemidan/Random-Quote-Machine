# Random Quote Machine
A simple application that generates random quotes and offers the possibility to share the quote on Twitter.

Used Math.random() and a Switch statement to choose among the quotes and assign it to a HTML-element. Manipulated link output through encodeURIComponent() to make it a pre-written tweet, containing the random quote and author.

Used Bootstrap for layout and Font Awesome for twitter button.
